## Voice of Customer Research

Key pain points from Reddit/forum research:

> "It's just so quiet. I have so much empty space, not only in my home but in my heart."

> "I feel like it wasn't enough. A lot of pain and regret that I didn't enjoy it enough..."

> "I don't even feel like I know my husband anymore. Our whole life has revolved around the kids."

> "Kids give you purpose... a much greater purpose than your own existence."

> "The silence. The empty house. Not knowing what to do with myself. Loss of purpose."
