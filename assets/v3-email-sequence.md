## Day 1: Why This Feels So Hard

**Subject:** [The Next Chapter] Day 1: Why This Feels So Hard

**Content:**

Hi there,

Welcome to The Next Chapter.

You signed up because something shifted. Maybe your last child just left. Maybe it happened months ago and you are still waiting for it to feel normal. Maybe you are dreading the day that is coming.

Whatever brought you here, I want you to know: you are not broken. You are not weak. And you are definitely not alone.

Today, I want to help you understand WHY this transition feels the way it does. Because once you understand it, everything changes.

---

THE IDENTITY EARTHQUAKE

Here is what nobody tells you about the empty nest: it is not just about missing your kids. It is about losing a version of yourself.

For decades, a huge part of your identity has been Parent. Not just the tasks - the driving, the cooking, the logistics - but the PURPOSE. The reason you got up early. The reason you pushed through hard days. The reason everything mattered.

And now? That role has not disappeared, but it has fundamentally changed. You are still a parent, but not in the same way. Not in the daily, hands-on, needed-every-moment way.

That is not a small shift. That is an identity earthquake.

---

THE GRIEF IS REAL

What you are feeling is grief. Real, legitimate grief.

You are grieving the daily presence of people you love. You are grieving a chapter of your life that will never come back. You are grieving the version of yourself who existed in that chapter.

And here is the thing about grief: it is not a sign of weakness. It is a sign of love.

The depth of what you are feeling is directly proportional to how much you gave. How much you cared. How much you loved.

So if this feels hard, it is because you did something extraordinary. You raised humans. You launched them into the world. That is not nothing. That is everything.

---

YOUR ASSIGNMENT FOR TODAY

I want you to do one thing today. Just one.

Find a quiet moment - maybe with your morning coffee, maybe before bed - and complete this sentence:

"The thing I miss most is not my child. It is _____________."

Maybe it is the sound of the house. Maybe it is having someone to cook for. Maybe it is feeling needed. Maybe it is knowing your purpose without having to think about it.

Whatever it is, name it. Write it down. Do not judge it.

This is the first step: understanding what you are actually grieving. Because it is rarely what you think.

---

Tomorrow, I am going to share something that might surprise you - a way to reframe this entire transition that changes everything.

Until then, be gentle with yourself. What you are feeling is not a problem to be solved. It is a passage to be honored.

You did something remarkable. Now it is time to discover what comes next.

## Day 2: The Freedom Reframe

**Subject:** [The Next Chapter] Day 2: The Freedom Reframe

**Content:**

Hi there,

Yesterday we talked about why this transition feels so hard. Today, I want to flip the script entirely.

Because here is something most people never realize: the empty nest is not just an ending. It is a beginning. And not just any beginning - it might be the most significant opportunity you have had in decades.

Let me explain.

---

THE QUESTION NOBODY ASKS

When your kids leave, everyone asks the same things:

"How are you holding up?"
"Are you okay?"
"What are you going to do with yourself?"

These questions assume something is wrong. That you are broken. That you need to be fixed.

But what if we asked a different question?

What if, instead of "How are you coping?" we asked:

"What becomes possible now that was not possible before?"

That is the Freedom Reframe. And it changes everything.

---

WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

Think about it. For the first time in decades, you have:

TIME that belongs entirely to you. No more scheduling around practices, performances, and pickups. No more being on-call 24/7.

FREEDOM to make decisions based solely on what you want. Want to eat cereal for dinner? Go ahead. Want to take a spontaneous weekend trip? Nothing stopping you.

SPACE to rediscover who you are outside of parenting. The interests you set aside. The dreams you filed under "someday." The version of yourself that existed before you became Mom or Dad.

PERMISSION to be selfish - in the best possible way. To invest in yourself. To prioritize your own growth, your own happiness, your own fulfillment.

This is not a consolation prize. This is the main event.

---

THE REFRAME IN ACTION

Here is how the Freedom Reframe works in practice:

OLD THOUGHT: "I do not know what to do with myself."
REFRAMED: "I get to decide what to do with myself - maybe for the first time ever."

OLD THOUGHT: "The house is so quiet."
REFRAMED: "The house is finally peaceful. I can hear myself think."

OLD THOUGHT: "I have lost my purpose."
REFRAMED: "I am free to discover a new purpose - one I choose, not one assigned to me."

OLD THOUGHT: "My best years are behind me."
REFRAMED: "My most intentional years are ahead of me."

This is not toxic positivity. It is not pretending the grief does not exist. It is holding two truths at once: this is hard AND this is an opportunity.

---

YOUR ASSIGNMENT FOR TODAY

I want you to complete this exercise:

Write down three things that are now possible that were not possible when your kids were home.

They can be big ("I could move to another city") or small ("I could sleep in on Saturdays"). They can be practical ("I could take a class") or dreamy ("I could finally write that book").

Do not filter. Do not judge. Just brainstorm.

Because here is the truth: the empty nest is not something that happened TO you. It is something that happened FOR you. The question is whether you will see it that way.

---

Tomorrow, we are going to tackle something that trips up almost every empty nester: how to stay connected to your adult children without being "that parent."

It is more counterintuitive than you might think.

Talk soon,
The Next Chapter Team

P.S. What three things did you write down? Hit reply and share - I love seeing what becomes possible when people start thinking this way.

## Day 3: The Reconnection Paradox

**Subject:** [The Next Chapter] Day 3: The Reconnection Paradox

**Content:**

Hi there,

Today we need to talk about something that keeps almost every empty nester up at night:

How do I stay close to my kids without being annoying?

It is a real fear. You do not want to be the parent who calls too much, texts too often, or shows up uninvited. You do not want to be clingy or needy or desperate.

But you also do not want to drift apart. You do not want to become strangers.

So you walk this impossible tightrope, second-guessing every text, overthinking every call, wondering if you are doing too much or too little.

Here is the truth nobody tells you: there is a paradox at the heart of this whole thing. And once you understand it, everything gets easier.

---

THE RECONNECTION PARADOX

Here it is, the counterintuitive truth:

The more you let go, the closer they come.

I know that sounds backwards. It feels like if you want to stay close, you should reach out more, check in more, be more present.

But that is not how adult relationships work.

When you hover, they pull away. When you cling, they create distance. When you need them to fill your emptiness, they feel the weight of that need - and they retreat.

But when you have your own full life? When you are genuinely busy and fulfilled and not waiting by the phone? Something magical happens.

They start reaching out to YOU.

Not because you guilted them. Not because they feel obligated. But because they genuinely want to.

---

WHY THIS WORKS

Think about it from their perspective.

Your adult child is building their own life. They are figuring out who they are, separate from you. They need space to do that - it is developmentally appropriate.

When you give them that space freely, without resentment, without guilt trips, without passive-aggressive comments about how they never call - you become safe.

You become the parent they WANT to talk to, not the parent they HAVE to talk to.

And that makes all the difference.

---

WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE IN PRACTICE

Letting go does not mean disappearing. It means:

REACHING OUT without expecting an immediate response. Send the text. Share the article. Say "thinking of you." Then put your phone down and go live your life.

BEING INTERESTED without being intrusive. Ask questions, but do not interrogate. Show curiosity, but respect boundaries.

SHARING YOUR LIFE without making it about them. Tell them about your new hobby, your trip, your funny story from work. Let them see you as a whole person, not just their parent.

CELEBRATING THEIR INDEPENDENCE even when it stings. When they do not need you, that is not a failure. That is the whole point. You raised them to not need you. Mission accomplished.

---

YOUR ASSIGNMENT FOR TODAY

I want you to do something that might feel uncomfortable:

Send your adult child a text that is NOT a question.

Do not ask how they are. Do not ask what they are doing. Do not ask when you will see them.

Instead, share something:

"Just saw the most ridiculous dog at the coffee shop - made me think of you."

"Started that show you recommended. You were right, it is amazing."

"Had the best tacos today. Reminded me of that place we went in Austin."

That is it. No question. No expectation of response. Just a small moment of connection.

This is what healthy adult relationships look like. Not obligation. Not guilt. Just genuine moments of "I was thinking of you."

---

Tomorrow, we are going to turn inward. Because the best thing you can do for your relationship with your kids is become someone with a full, interesting life of your own.

We will talk about how to rediscover the YOU that got lost in the parenting years.

Talk soon,
The Next Chapter Team

P.S. Did you send the text? What did you share? Hit reply and tell me - I love hearing these stories.

## Day 4: Rediscovering You

**Subject:** [The Next Chapter] Day 4: Rediscovering You

**Content:**

Hi there,

We have spent the last few days talking about the transition, the opportunity, and your relationship with your kids.

Today, we turn inward. Because here is the thing:

The best thing you can do for everyone in your life - your kids, your partner, your friends - is become someone with a rich, full, interesting life of your own.

Not for them. For YOU.

But here is the challenge: after decades of putting everyone else first, you might not even know what that looks like anymore.

---

THE PERSON YOU USED TO BE

Before you were a parent, you were a person.

You had interests. Hobbies. Dreams. Things that lit you up. Things you could lose hours doing without noticing the time pass.

Maybe you painted. Maybe you played music. Maybe you ran marathons or wrote poetry or dreamed of traveling the world.

Then kids happened. And slowly, imperceptibly, those things got pushed aside. Not abandoned - just... postponed. Filed under "someday when I have time."

Well, someday is here. You have time now.

The question is: do you remember what you wanted to do with it?

---

THE REDISCOVERY EXERCISE

I want to walk you through a simple but powerful exercise. Grab a piece of paper and answer these questions:

1. BEFORE KIDS: What did you love doing before you became a parent? What activities made you lose track of time? What did you dream about?

2. DURING KIDS: What interests did you discover during the parenting years that you never had time to fully explore? Maybe you got into cooking, or gardening, or a particular type of music.

3. ALWAYS WANTED: What have you always wanted to try but never had the chance? Learn a language? Take a pottery class? Write a book? Travel somewhere specific?

4. ADMIRE IN OTHERS: When you see other people doing something and think "I wish I could do that" - what is it? This often points to hidden desires.

5. CHILDHOOD CLUES: What did you love doing as a child, before anyone told you what you "should" be interested in? Our childhood passions often hold clues to our authentic selves.

---

THE PERMISSION SLIP

Here is something important: you do not need permission to pursue these things. But I am going to give it to you anyway.

You are allowed to have hobbies that are just for you.

You are allowed to spend money on things that bring you joy.

You are allowed to be a beginner at something new.

You are allowed to change your mind about what you want.

You are allowed to have a life that is not centered on your children.

In fact, you are not just allowed - you are supposed to. This is the whole point of this chapter. Not to wait around for your kids to need you. But to become the fullest, most alive version of yourself.

---

YOUR ASSIGNMENT FOR TODAY

Complete the Rediscovery Exercise above. Write down at least 5 things across those categories.

Then pick ONE thing from your list and take a tiny step toward it today.

Not a big commitment. Not signing up for a year-long class. Just one tiny step:

Google "pottery classes near me."
Dust off that old guitar.
Order that book you have been meaning to read.
Text a friend about that trip you have always talked about.

One tiny step. That is all.

Because here is what I have learned: the people who thrive in this chapter are not the ones who wait for inspiration to strike. They are the ones who take action - even small action - and let the inspiration follow.

---

Tomorrow is our final day together, and I am going to give you a complete blueprint for designing your next chapter. A framework you can use to actually build the life you want.

But for today, just focus on rediscovering YOU.

Talk soon,
The Next Chapter Team

P.S. What did you rediscover? What tiny step are you taking? Hit reply and tell me - these responses genuinely make my day.

## Day 5: Your Next Chapter Blueprint

**Subject:** [The Next Chapter] Day 5: Your Next Chapter Blueprint

**Content:**

Hi there,

We made it to Day 5.

Over the past four days, we have covered a lot of ground:

- Why this transition feels so hard (and why that is actually a sign of how deeply you loved)
- The Freedom Reframe (seeing this as an opportunity, not just a loss)
- The Reconnection Paradox (how letting go brings your kids closer)
- Rediscovering You (reconnecting with the person you were before parenting took over)

Today, I want to pull it all together and give you a blueprint. A framework for actually designing and building your next chapter.

Because understanding is one thing. Action is another.

---

THE NEXT CHAPTER BLUEPRINT

Here is the framework I use with everyone I work with. It has four pillars:

PILLAR 1: IDENTITY
Who are you becoming?

This is the foundation. You cannot build a fulfilling life if you do not know who you are trying to become.

Ask yourself: In five years, who do I want to be? Not what do I want to have or do - who do I want to BE?

Maybe you want to be someone who is adventurous. Creative. Healthy. Connected. Peaceful. Curious.

Write down 3-5 identity words. These become your compass.

PILLAR 2: RELATIONSHIPS
Who matters most?

Your relationships are about to change. Your kids are becoming adults. Your partner (if you have one) is becoming your primary companion again. Your friendships may need rekindling.

Ask yourself: Which relationships do I want to deepen? Which ones have I neglected? What kind of friend, partner, and parent do I want to be in this chapter?

PILLAR 3: PURPOSE
What gives you meaning?

Parenting gave you built-in purpose. Now you get to choose.

Purpose does not have to be grand. It can be creative (making things), connective (helping people), explorative (learning and discovering), or contributive (giving back).

Ask yourself: What activities make me feel most alive? What problems do I care about solving? What would I do even if nobody paid me?

PILLAR 4: STRUCTURE
How will you spend your days?

Freedom without structure becomes chaos. You need rhythms, routines, and commitments that pull you forward.

Ask yourself: What does an ideal week look like? What regular activities do I want to commit to? What boundaries do I need to protect my time and energy?

---

YOUR 30-DAY KICKSTART

Here is a simple plan to put this blueprint into action:

WEEK 1: REFLECT
Complete the exercises from this email series. Journal on the four pillars. Get clear on who you want to become.

WEEK 2: EXPERIMENT
Try one new thing. Take a class. Join a group. Start a project. Do not commit to anything long-term - just experiment.

WEEK 3: CONNECT
Reach out to three people you have lost touch with. Schedule one meaningful conversation with your partner or a close friend. Practice the reconnection techniques with your adult children.

WEEK 4: COMMIT
Based on what you learned in weeks 1-3, make one commitment. Join something. Start something. Schedule something recurring. Put structure around your intentions.

---

WHAT COMES NEXT

This 5-day guide was designed to give you a foundation. A new way of seeing this transition. A starting point.

But I know that for many of you, you want more.

You want the specific scripts for reconnecting with your adult children.
You want the exercises for reigniting your relationship with your partner.
You want the community of people who actually get what you are going through.
You want the accountability to actually follow through.

That is why we created The Next Chapter Toolkit and The Next Chapter Circle.

THE TOOLKIT ($47) gives you everything you need to take action: reconnection scripts, conversation guides, the passion rediscovery workbook, and 12 weeks of reflection prompts.

THE CIRCLE ($29/month) gives you ongoing support: a private community of parents in this same transition, monthly live calls, and continuous guidance as you build your next chapter.

If you are ready to go deeper, you can learn more here: [LINK]

But even if you never buy anything from us, I hope this guide has been valuable. I hope it has helped you see this transition differently. I hope it has given you permission to build a life that is truly yours.

Because here is what I believe with my whole heart:

Your kids did not leave so you could shrink. They left so you could grow.

Your next chapter is waiting. Go write it.

With gratitude,
The Next Chapter Team
